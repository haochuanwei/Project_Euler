    Idea: consider the vectors v1, v2, v3 where vi = [xi, yi].
    Any other point u can be writte as a linear combination of the vectors
    i.e. av1 + bv2 + cv3 = [xu, yu] where a + b + c = 1.
    So we have
    ax1 + bx2 + cx3 = xu
    ay1 + by2 + cy3 = yu
     a  +  b  +  c  = 1
    Which is a Ax=b problem.

    u is in the interior iff each of a, b, c is nonnegative.
